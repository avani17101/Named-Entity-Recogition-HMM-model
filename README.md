# Named-Entity-Recogition-HMM-model
Part of assignment in Information Retrieval and Extraction course at IIIT Hyderabad. Made an HMM model for NER dataset of Hindi News Articles created by me.

                               NER in your native language
Select 20-25 news articles of reasonable size (more than 250 words) in your native language.
Highlight and understand the NEs and come up with the Named Entity Rules/Grammars to recognize such grammars and also create HMM model for the dataset you have created similar to the one discussed in the class about address segmentation. Your deliverables (each as a PDF document)



1. Data set of 20-25 news stories in your native language 

2. NEs in each of the news stories 

3. Named Entity Rules/Grammar and HMM model
